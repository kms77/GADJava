Project One - Abstract Factory Design Pattern
---------------------------------------------

Problem Description

George is the owner of a business based on orchards of apple trees, cherry trees and pear trees. Also, because the business is developing he needs to create 
departments: delivery department, managerial department and orchard department. He needs an application to keep track of each orchard and each department. An orchard 
consists of the number of trees planted and the orchard information - text descrption of it. A department has a name and a number of employees.

Problem Solution

In order to solve this problem I used the Abstract Factory Design Pattern because the application consists of multiple families of objects which are designed to be used
together. The Abstract Factory uses a Factory Provider class which determine the factory to be used in the object creation: DepartmentFactory or Orchard Factory.
Department Factory uses the create function which has as parameter the string name of the department to be created. Using the Department interface objects like 
DeliveryDepartment, ManagerialDepartment or OrchardDepartment are created. The same method is applied in the case of Orchard Factory where AppleOrchard, CherryOrchard or
PearOrchard can be created.
